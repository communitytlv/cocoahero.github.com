If you wish to contact me to ask a question, report a bug, or just talk nerd, shoot me an email [here](mailto:jonathan@cocoahero.com).  You can also contact me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cocoahero) or [Github](http://github.com/cocoahero).

If you are contacting me regarding a bug in an application or any other product of mine, please be as descriptive as possible. The more information I have on what you did and what happened, the faster and easier it is for me to fix it! Thanks!
