In my spare time, I have a singing hobby known as "barbershop".  No, I do not mean I sing while cutting people's hair.  Barbershop is a genre of singing that is known for close four part harmony and men dressed in red striped suspenders.  It is a thriving community especially now that more and more youth (like me) are getting involved.

Usually after a barbershop concert, event, or any sort of meeting, a party is usually held called an "afterglow".  During these meetings after the meetings, people congregate and often get into quartets to sing what are known as "tags".  Tags are short pieces of music, often snipped from the end of a longer song or tune.  There are tons of these tags and while many people have some of them memorized, it's always nice to have a reference when learning new ones.

Soon, iPhone owners will be able to download and install my newest and latest app appropriately called "Afterglow".  With this app, users can search and view information on over 1,400 tags courtesy of [barbershoptags.com](http://barbershoptags.com)!  This includes sheet music and learning tracks if available.

Look out for it hitting the App Store soon!
