So I have been pondering and pondering the if's, when's, and how's of a development diary blog.  What do I mean by a "development diary blog"? I wish I knew myself, but it seems like a popular thing these days.

After I decided that I wanted a dev blog, next came the question of how.  Now owning my own VPS (Virtual Private Server) is nice and all.  However, configuring it just the way I want it is a pain.  I love WordPress and its ability for customization.  But I just didn't want the overhead of maintaining my own install for such a small blog.  To get WordPress up and running would mean upgrading my web hosting stack to include a reliable PHP setup.  You may say that I'm lazy for not doing it.  Trust me, I tried.  I'll post about that disaster at a later time.

Enter tumblr.  I have heard of its existence before, but never investigated.  I must say, start to finish, one of the fastest get up and go blogging platforms period.  Even setting up my custom domain was a piece of cake.  So I think I'm settled with tumblr for now.  I doubt it will leave me wanting more features.
