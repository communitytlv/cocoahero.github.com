Hello! I'm Jonathan, a 23 year old technology fanatic. You have stumbled upon the place that describes me through my work and my written thoughts on various subjects.

In both my professional career and in my spare time, I have become an avid software developer who enjoys a good challenge. Beautiful design and well thoughtout user experience are non-negotiable requirements for any project that I am involved in.

Please enjoy your stay and if you wish to contact me, you can find out how [here](/contact/).
